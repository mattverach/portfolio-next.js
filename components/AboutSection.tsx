            Hello, my name is Mat√≠as Vera, and I am a software developer based in CABA, Buenos Aires and Im fluent both in English and Spanish. I have over a year of experience as a Software Developer, working for a world-renowned bank, where I mostly use Java with Spring Framework to develop APIs that communicate the frontend of the bank with Salesforce. I also developed several systems within Salesforce, which allowed me to gain a deep understanding of the platform.
            </p>

            <p>
            What drives me in life is making progress and learning new things. I am passionate about advancing in my field and constantly improving my skills. I find it exciting to be a part of the ever-evolving tech industry, and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities.
